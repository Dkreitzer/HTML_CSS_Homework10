# JupyterNotebook_Dashboard


### Very first website ever created using images from Dkreitzer/Random_500-City_Weather_Analysis
#### I purposly have not revisited this project to improve on the CSS or web content so I have a reminder of what my first website looked like.

#### The project is pretty straight forward:
#### Incorporate the matplotlib images created in the Jupyter Notebook project Dkreitzer/Random_500-City_Weather_Analysis into a bootstrap html website.
